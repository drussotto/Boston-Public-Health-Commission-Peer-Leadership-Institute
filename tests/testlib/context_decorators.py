# This decorator takes a username and password to attempt a login with
# if no password is provided then "username" is treated like a user object.
# the optional 'to' argument specifies what the 'next' query argument of the login
# should be. If left empty next won't be given in the url.
# The function this decorates can take either 1 or 2 additional aguments (excluding self)
# if your test function takes one additional argument, a test_client is supplied
# which is logged in with the username and password. If your function takes 2 additional arguments
# the second one will be the response from the login call (will be the index page if you didn't)
# supply a 'to' keyword arg. The function that is being decorated is run inside the request context
# of the given client.
